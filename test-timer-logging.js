/**
 * Simple test to verify timer multiple session logging
 *
 * Steps to test:
 * 1. Create an issue with estimate (e.g., 1 hour)
 * 2. Move to IN_PROGRESS (should start timer)
 * 3. Wait ~1 minute
 * 4. Move to DONE (should log time)
 * 5. Move back to IN_PROGRESS (should restart timer)
 * 6. Wait ~1 minute
 * 7. Move to DONE again (should log time again)
 * 8. Check progress bar shows cumulative time

console.log('🧪 Timer Multiple Session Test Plan');
console.log('====================================');
console.log('1. Look for console logs starting with 🚀, 🕐, ✅, 📝, 📊, 🔄');
console.log('2. Watch for "Starting new timer" vs "Restarting completed timer"');
console.log('3. Verify time logging occurs on each DONE transition');
console.log('4. Check progress bar accumulates across sessions');
console.log('5. Minimum logging threshold is 0.01h (36 seconds)');
